## The company

Shiksha is a new way to learn, teach and mentor. The main attraction of our company is the fact that we found a way to convert any generic phone camera into a hologram. Thus, giving you a surreal experience while learning, chatting or having fun with your friends.

## The website

The website we developed has an extremely simple and minimal look. It uses a single font (Europa - regular, bold). We went for a much simpler look because for an application as important as this, everyone should be able to use it, no matter what phone/device they have. 

Thus, special work has been put in to make this website responsive so that it looks perfect on every device. You don't need to have the latest devices, it works just as well on older laptops and phones.

Education is something everyone deserves, so I believe that this pandemic should not stop anyone from learning. So my main motive was to make it lightweight and convey information clearly for everyone to access. The goal was to keep it as simple as possible but make it look great.

SVGs were used as far as possible to reduce file sizes and improve load times. Every asset used on the website is optimized.

Cool parallax effects were added tho ;)

Also note: Illustrations, Icons, and other svg assets have been designed/customized by our team.

Thank you, we hope you like it :)
